## Version 1.1.5 (2025-10-23)

**New Features:**

- Added Alt+X hotkey for dock position reset

## Version 1.1.4 (2025-10-22)

**Optimization:**

- Pet swapping now skips already-equipped pets to prevent unnecessary network calls

**Technical Details:**

- Added equipped check to `loadPetPreset()` function
- Added equipped check to `placePetPreset()` function
- Added equipped check to Quick Load button handler
- Added equipped check to pet popout preset click handler

**Why This Matters:**

- Previous versions sent SwapPet messages even when pet was already equipped

---

## Version 1.1.3 (2025-10-22)

**Bug Fixes:**

**Technical Details:**

- Created debounced wrapper for `placePetPreset` function
- Replaced inline pet swapping code with centralized debounced function
- Reduces server load and prevents race conditions during rapid clicking

**Why This Matters:**

- Previous versions allowed rapid double-clicks to send duplicate swap commands
- Debouncing ensures only one swap operation runs at a time
- Improves reliability and reduces potential for unexpected behavior

---

## Version 1.1.1 (2025-10-22)

**Critical Bug Fix:**

- Fixed pet swapping to work with FULL inventory (100/100 items)
- Replaced broken StorePet/PlacePet approach with native SwapPet messages
- Pet preset swapping now works atomically without requiring free inventory slots

**Implementation Details:**

- 5 handler locations updated to use native game swap mechanism
- For each slot: SwapPet exchanges active pet ↔ inventory pet directly
- Empty slots still use PlacePet, excess pets use StorePet
- 100ms delays between operations for connection reliability

**UI Improvements:**

- Version checker now clearly shows "Your Branch (Beta/Stable)" vs "Other Branch"
- Removed excessive debug console logs for cleaner console output
- Beta version displays with orange/yellow colors, Stable with green colors

**Why This Matters:**

- Previous fix (v1.1.0) added delays but still failed with full inventory
- Native SwapPet bypasses inventory space requirement completely
- Users can now swap pets regardless of inventory fullness
