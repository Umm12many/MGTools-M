## 🎮 Discord Compatibility

MGTools works when playing Magic Garden through **Discord's activity embed**, but with limitations:

**Recommended Setup:**
1. Right-click the game in Discord
2. Click **"Open in Browser"** or **"Pop Out"**
3. MGTools will work perfectly in the new window/tab

**Why?**: Discord's iframe has security restrictions (CORS) that prevent some features from working correctly.

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### UI Not Appearing?

### Crop Values Not Showing?
- Make sure you're standing directly on a crop tile

### Features Not Working?
- Ensure you're on the latest version (check Settings → About)

- Check for script conflicts in Tampermonkey

### Shop Not Refreshing?
